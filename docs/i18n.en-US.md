The default language of `metisui` is English. If you need to use other languages, you can refer to the following solutions.

## ConfigProvider

`metisui` provides a React component [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider) for globally configuring internationalization.

```jsx
import zhCN from 'metis-ui/locale/zh_CN';

return (
  <ConfigProvider locale={zhCN}>
    <App />
  </ConfigProvider>
);
```

For detailed configuration, see: [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider).

Note: zh_CN is the file name, and the following table follows the same naming convention.

Currently supported languages:

| Language           | File Name |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| English            | en_US     |
| Simplified Chinese | zh_CN     |

For specific usage, please refer to the [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider) documentation.
